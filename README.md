<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- osTicket

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Have the osTicket software successsfully installed onto a virtual machine and configured with all of the items that we created in the last walkthrough.
 
<h2>Overview</h2>

In this walkthrough we're going to be creating tickets as end users and observing all the ticket properties and responding to them as help desk professionals. Solving mock tickets gives us a feel for how we would use the osTicket software to solve issues in real world scenarios, and deepens our understanding with the osTicket software.


<h2>Tickets and Ticket Lifecycle</h2>

- Maintenance Department

Before we start creating mock tickets we're going to go over and delete the maintenance department to prevent tickets from getting auto assigned to it, as it sometimes has a tendacy to do so. To do that we're going to need to be logged into osTicket as an admin, before clicking on the 'Admin Panel' at the top right of the screen. Once there click on the 'Agents' tab, and navigate to the departments section.

From here deleting the maintenance department is pretty simple, we just need to check the box on the left hand side, then hit the 'More' button near the top right. 'Delete' should be an option that appears underneath the 'More' dropdown menu. It will ask you to confirm once more before allowing you to actually delete the department.
